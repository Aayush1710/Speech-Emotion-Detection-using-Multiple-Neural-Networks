# Speech-Emotion-Detection-using-Multiple-Neural-Networks
This is Matlab Implementation in Objective C++ for detecting speech emotions using a recorded data set for 5 emotions namely - angry, crying, exited, happy and neutral.
Multiple neural networks and SVM techniques used where the data was passed from.
vrec.m file is used for recorded emotions aand each file will have a folder to access the files of varied emotions access from basically path of the data set.
The output gives us a comparison of how well various AI networks and techniques perform for the task
